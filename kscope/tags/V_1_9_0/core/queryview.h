/**
 * A view for displaying query results.
 * Results can be displayed either as either a list or a tree (for call trees).
 * Since the class implements Engine::Connection, an object of this type can be
 * passed to an engine's query() method. Progress will be displayed in the
 * form of a progress-bar at the top of the view.
 * There are two ways in which the widget can be used to view query results:
 * 1. Constructing the widget and passing it to an engine's query() method;
 * 2. Using the widget's own query() method.
 * For the latter to work, engine() needs to be specialised. This is a
 * compromise between functionality and good design. Functionality requires an
 * engine to be available to the widget, in order to be able to refresh queries
 * and expand tree items by itself. Good design requires that we do not keep
 * an embedded engine object/pointer in this class.
 * Note that the tree view can only work with option 2, as the queryTreeItem()
 * method, connected to the expanded() signal, uses the engine to query run a
 * query on a child item.
