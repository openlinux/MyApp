This is min-cscope, an enhanced version of the veteran Cscope, originally from 
Bell Labs.
The program offers all of the functionality, as well as the appearance, of 
Cscope, with the following modifications:
 - CMake-based makefile generation system
 - Built-in sorting capabilities used for creating the inverted index
 - The curses interface is optional, enabling min-cscope to be easily built on i
   platforms that do not have a curses-compatible library (e.g., Windows)

The program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, i
version 3.
